4. **2x4 Decoder**
5. **4x1 Multiplexer**
6. **D Flip-Flop with Reset**
7. **4-bit Comparator**
8. **Counter**
9. **Simple NOT Gate**
10. **NOT Gate with ON**
11. **NOT Gate with WAIT UNTIL**
12. **NOT Gate with WAIT UNTIL**

## Project Descriptions

### 1-bit Full Adder
A VHDL implementation of a 1-bit full adder. It takes two single-bit inputs and a carry-in, producing a sum and a carry-out.

### 4-bit Full Adder
A 4-bit full adder that cascades four 1-bit full adders. It takes two 4-bit inputs and a carry-in, producing a 4-bit sum and a carry-out.

### 16-bit Full Adder
A 16-bit full adder that cascades four 4-bit full adders. It takes two 16-bit inputs and a carry-in, producing a 16-bit sum and a carry-out.

### 128-bit Full Adder
A 128-bit full adder that cascades two 64-bit full adders. It takes two 128-bit inputs and a carry-in, producing a 128-bit sum and a carry-out.
1 > 4 > 8 > 16 > 32 > 64 > 128

### 2x4 Decoder
A 2-to-4 line decoder. It takes a 2-bit input and activates one of the four outputs based on the input combination.

### 4x1 Multiplexer
A 4-to-1 multiplexer. It selects one of the four inputs to pass to the output based on a 2-bit selector input.

### D Flip-Flop with Reset
A D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset. It stores the value of the D input on the rising edge of the clock and can be reset asynchronously.

### 4-bit Comparator
A comparator that compares two 4-bit numbers and outputs whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

### Counter
A simple counter that counts up or down based on the input control signals.

### Simple NOT Gate
A basic NOT gate that inverts the input signal.

### NOT Gate with ON
A NOT gate that includes an enable signal. The NOT gate only functions when the enable signal is ON.

### NOT Gate with WAIT UNTIL
A NOT gate that waits until a specific condition is met before inverting the input.

### AND Gate with WAIT UNTIL
An AND gate that waits until a specific condition is met before performing the AND operation.

## Getting Started

To use these VHDL projects, you will need:

- Xilinx ISE installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of VHDL and digital design principles.
